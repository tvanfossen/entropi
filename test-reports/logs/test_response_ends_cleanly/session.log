Okay, the user is asking for three programming languages and their main use cases. Let me think about which languages to choose. They should be popular and have distinct use cases.

First, JavaScript comes to mind because it's widely used for web development. Both front-end and back-end with Node.js. That's a solid choice.

Next, Python is great for data science, machine learning, and scripting. It's versatile and has a lot of libraries supporting those areas. That covers another major area.

For the third, maybe Java? It's commonly used in enterprise applications and Android development. But wait, maybe something more modern? Or perhaps C++ for system-level programming? Hmm. Alternatively, Ruby for web apps with Rails. Wait, but the user might want more current examples. Let me check. Python is definitely a safe pick. Java is still relevant for large-scale systems. Maybe Rust for systems programming? But Rust is newer. The user didn't specify the era. 

Alternatively, maybe PHP for web development, but it's less popular now. Let me stick with Java for enterprise and Android. So three languages: JavaScript, Python, Java. Their use cases would be web dev, data science, and enterprise apps/android. That should cover different domains. I need to present them clearly. Make sure each has a concise description. Alright, that's the plan.
