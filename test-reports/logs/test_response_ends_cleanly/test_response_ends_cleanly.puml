  **Model Output:**
  Here are three programming languages and their primary use cases:
  
  1. **JavaScript**  
     - **Main Use Cases**: Front-end web development (browser-based interactive 
  features), back-end development (with Node.js), and mobile app development (via 
  frameworks like React Native).
  
  2. **Python**  
     - **Main Use Cases**: Data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, 
  automation scripting, and rapid application development due to its simplicity 
  and extensive libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow).
  
  3. **Java**  
     - **Main Use Cases**: Enterprise software development, Android app 
  development, large-scale distributed systems, and backend services (e.g., Java 
  EE/Spring frameworks).
