  **Model Output:**
  Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a 
  problem by breaking it down into smaller, simpler subproblems. It consists of 
  two main components:
  
  1. **Base Case**: The condition that stops the recursion (prevents infinite 
  loops).
  2. **Recursive Step**: The function call that reduces the problem size and 
  progresses toward the base case.
  
  ### Example: Factorial Calculation
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      if n == 0:  # Base case
          return 1
      else:       # Recursive step
          return n * factorial(n - 1)
  ```
  
  ### Key Considerations:
  - **Stack Depth**: Each recursive call adds a stack frame, risking stack 
  overflow for deep recursions.
  - **Performance**: Can be less efficient than iterative solutions due to 
  function call overhead.
  - **Tail Recursion**: Some languages optimize tail-recursive calls (where the 
  recursive call is the final operation), but Python does not support this 
  natively.
  
  Recursion is ideal for problems with natural hierarchical structures (e.g., tree
  traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms).
