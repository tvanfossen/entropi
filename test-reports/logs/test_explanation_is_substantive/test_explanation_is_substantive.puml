  **Model Output:**
  Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a
  problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. Here's a 
  structured breakdown:
  
  ### Key Components
  1. **Base Case**: 
     - The condition that stops the recursion (prevents infinite loops).
     - Example: `if n &lt;= 1 return 1` in factorial calculations.
  
  2. **Recursive Step**:
     - The function calls itself with modified parameters to reduce the problem 
  size.
     - Example: `return n * factorial(n-1)` for factorial.
  
  ### Example: Factorial Calculation
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      if n &lt;= 1:  # Base case
          return 1
      else:       # Recursive step
          return n * factorial(n-1)
  ```
  
  ### Key Considerations
  - **Call Stack**: Each recursive call adds a stack frame, which can lead to 
  stack overflow for deep recursions.
  - **Efficiency**: Recursive solutions may have higher memory overhead compared 
  to iterative approaches.
  - **Tail Recursion**: Some languages optimize tail-recursive calls (where the 
  recursive call is the final operation), but Python does not support this 
  natively.
  
  ### When to Use Recursion
  - Problems with natural recursive structures (e.g., tree traversals, 
  divide-and-conquer algorithms).
  - When the recursive approach simplifies code readability and maintainability.

  language?
