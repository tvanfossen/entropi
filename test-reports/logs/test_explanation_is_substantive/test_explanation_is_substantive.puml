  **Model Output:**
  Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a
  problem by breaking it down into smaller, similar subproblems. It relies on two 
  key components:
  
  1. **Base Case**: A condition that stops the recursion (prevents infinite 
  loops).
  2. **Recursive Step**: The function calls itself with modified parameters to 
  tackle a smaller instance of the problem.
  
  ### Example: Factorial Calculation
  ```python
  def factorial(n):
      if n == 0:  # Base case
          return 1
      else:       # Recursive step
          return n * factorial(n - 1)
  ```
  
  ### Key Concepts:
  - **Call Stack**: Each recursive call adds a frame to the stack until the base 
  case is reached.
  - **Stack Overflow Risk**: Deep recursion can exhaust memory (e.g., 
  `factorial(10000)` would crash).
  - **Tail Recursion**: Some languages optimize recursive calls that occur as the 
  final operation (not universally supported).
  
  ### When to Use It:
  - Problems with natural recursive structures (e.g., tree traversals, 
  divide-and-conquer algorithms).
  - Avoid for large inputs unless optimized.
  
  Let me know if you'd like to explore specific examples or compare recursion vs. 
  iteration!
