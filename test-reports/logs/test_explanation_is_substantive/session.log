Okay, the user is asking about recursion in programming. Let me start by defining it clearly. Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem. I should mention that it's useful for tasks that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems.

Wait, I need to make sure I explain the base case and the recursive case. Without a base case, the recursion would never stop, leading to infinite loops. Maybe give an example, like calculating factorial or Fibonacci numbers.

Also, I should compare recursion with iteration. While both can solve similar problems, recursion might be more straightforward for certain tasks but can be less efficient due to stack usage. Oh, and mention the call stack and potential stack overflow issues.

Let me check if there's anything else important. Maybe include a simple code example to illustrate the concept. Make sure to explain each part of the example. Alright, that should cover the basics without getting too deep into advanced topics.
