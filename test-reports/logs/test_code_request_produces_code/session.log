Okay, the user wants a Python function to check if a number is even. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that an even number is divisible by 2 without any remainder. So the basic idea is to check if the number modulo 2 equals zero.

Wait, but what about negative numbers? Like -4. Modulo in Python handles negatives, but maybe the user just wants to check the absolute value. Hmm, but the problem statement doesn't specify, so I'll assume that any integer is acceptable. For example, -4 % 2 is 0, so it would return True. That's correct.

So the function can take an integer as input. Let me outline the steps:

1. Define a function called is_even that takes one parameter, num.
2. Check if num % 2 == 0.
3. Return True if yes, else False.

Wait, but what if the input isn't an integer? Like a float. For example, 3.0 is technically even, but maybe the user expects integers. The problem says "a number," which could be a float. But in programming terms, evenness is usually for integers. So perhaps the function should handle integers only. But the user didn't specify, so I'll make it accept any number and check if the remainder when divided by 2 is zero. That includes floats, but in practice, it's more common to check integers.

Alternatively, maybe the user expects the input to be an integer. So perhaps adding a check for type? But that might complicate things. The problem statement doesn't mention handling non-integers, so I'll proceed with the basic approach.

So the code would be:

def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

Wait, but in Python, if you pass a float like 4.0, it will return True. But if you pass 3.5, it returns 1.0, which is not zero. So that's correct.

But maybe the user wants to ensure that the input is an integer. However, since the problem statement doesn't specify, I'll proceed with the simple implementation.

Testing some cases: is_even(4) → True, is_even(5) → False, is_even(-2) → True. All correct.

So the function is straightforward. Now, I need to present it as the answer.
