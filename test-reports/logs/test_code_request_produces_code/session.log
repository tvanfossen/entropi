Okay, the user wants a Python function to check if a number is even. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I know that an even number is divisible by 2 without any remainder. So the basic idea is to check if the number modulo 2 equals zero.

Wait, but what about negative numbers? Oh, right, modulo works for negatives too. For example, -4 % 2 is 0, so it's even. So the function doesn't need to handle negatives specially.

So the function can take an integer as input. Let me outline the steps:
1. Define a function, maybe called is_even, that takes one parameter, num.
2. Check if num % 2 == 0.
3. Return True if yes, else False.

Wait, but what if the input isn't an integer? The problem statement probably assumes the input is an integer. So we don't need to handle floats unless specified. For example, 4.0 would be even, but 3.5 would not. However, the user didn't mention handling non-integer inputs, so maybe stick to integers.

So the code would be straightforward. Let me write that.

Testing edge cases: 0 is even, right? Yes. So testing 0 should return True. Also, numbers like 1, 2, -1, -2, etc.

Wait, but the user just wants a function. Maybe include a docstring explaining it. But the user didn't specify, so maybe keep it simple.

So the function would be:

def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

That's it. Let me make sure there are no errors. For example, if someone passes a non-integer, like a string, it would throw an error. But again, the problem assumes the input is a number.

I think that's all. The user might also want examples of usage, but the question only asks for the function. So the answer is the function as written.
