Okay, the user wants a function that returns the sum of a list. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements. The function should take a list of numbers and return their sum. But wait, what if the list is empty? Should the function handle that case? Maybe return 0 in that scenario.

Next, I should consider the programming language. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume Python as it's commonly used for such tasks. In Python, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum. Alternatively, using the built-in sum() function would be more efficient and concise.

Wait, but if the user wants to see the implementation, maybe they want the manual approach. Let me check. The question is straightforward, so providing a simple solution with the built-in function makes sense unless there's a specific reason to avoid it.

So, the function could be as simple as:

def sum_list(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

But I should include a note about handling empty lists. Wait, the sum of an empty list in Python is 0, so that's already covered. So the function works for all cases.

Alternatively, if they want to implement it manually, using a loop:

def sum_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

Which one is better? The built-in function is more efficient and readable. But maybe the user wants the manual method. Since the question is vague, I'll provide both options and explain.

Wait, but the user asked to write a function. Either approach is valid. Let me go with the built-in function as it's concise and handles all cases, including empty lists. That should cover the requirement.
