Okay, the user wants a function that returns the sum of a list. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirement. The function should take a list of numbers and return their sum. But wait, what if the list is empty? Should the function handle that case? Maybe return 0 in that scenario.

Next, I should consider the programming language. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume Python as it's commonly used for such tasks. In Python, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum. Alternatively, using the built-in sum() function would be more efficient and concise.

Wait, but if the user wants to see the implementation, maybe they want an example using a loop. Let me check. The question is straightforward, so providing both methods could be helpful. However, the user might just need a simple solution. Let's go with the built-in sum function for simplicity unless there's a reason to use a loop.

Also, I should include error handling. What if the input isn't a list? Or if the elements aren't numbers? But the problem statement doesn't mention handling such cases, so maybe it's beyond the scope. The user might just want the basic functionality.

So, the function would look like this: def sum_list(numbers): return sum(numbers). That's it. But wait, in Python, if the list is empty, sum returns 0, which is correct. So that handles the empty case automatically.

I should test this with some examples. For instance, sum_list([1,2,3]) should return 6. And sum_list([]) returns 0. That seems right.

Alternatively, if they want a manual implementation, using a loop: initialize total to 0, iterate through each element adding to total. But again, the built-in function is more efficient.

I think the best approach is to use the built-in sum function. So the code is straightforward. Let me present that as the solution.
