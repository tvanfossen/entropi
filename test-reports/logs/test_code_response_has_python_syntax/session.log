Okay, the user wants a function that returns the sum of a list. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirement. The function should take a list of numbers and return their sum. But wait, what if the list is empty? Should the function handle that case? Maybe return 0 in that scenario.

Next, I should consider the programming language. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume Python as it's commonly used for such tasks. In Python, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum. Alternatively, using the built-in sum() function would be more efficient and concise.

Wait, but if the user wants to see the implementation, maybe they want an example using a loop. Let me check both options. The built-in sum function is straightforward, but implementing it manually might be better for learning purposes.

Let me draft the function. For example:

def sum_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

But I should also handle the case where the input isn't a list. Maybe add a check to ensure the input is a list. However, the user might just want the basic functionality. Let me keep it simple unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, using the built-in sum function:

def sum_list(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

That's even shorter. But does the user want to see the manual implementation? Since they asked for a function that returns the sum, either approach is valid. I'll go with the built-in method as it's more efficient and Pythonic.

Wait, but maybe the user wants to handle empty lists. The sum of an empty list is 0, which is already handled by the built-in sum function. So that's covered.

I should also mention that the function works for any iterable, not just lists. But again, the user's request is specific to a list.

So the final function would be as simple as using sum(). I'll present that and maybe offer to implement it manually if needed.
