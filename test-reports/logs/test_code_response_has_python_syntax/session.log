Okay, the user wants a function that returns the sum of a list. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirement. The function should take a list of numbers and return their sum. But wait, what if the list is empty? Should the function handle that case? Maybe return 0 in that scenario.

Next, I should consider the programming language. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume Python as it's commonly used for such tasks. In Python, you can use a loop to iterate through the list and accumulate the sum. Alternatively, using the built-in sum() function would be more efficient and concise.

Wait, but if the user wants to see an implementation, maybe they want the loop approach to understand the logic. However, using sum() is straightforward. Let me check both options.

Option 1: Using built-in sum()
def sum_list(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

This handles empty lists by returning 0, which is correct.

Option 2: Manual summation
def sum_list(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

Both options work. Which one should I present? The user might prefer the built-in function for simplicity. But maybe they want to see the manual method. Since the question is straightforward, using the built-in function is more efficient and less error-prone.

I should also mention that the function handles empty lists correctly. Let me verify with an example. If the list is empty, sum() returns 0, which is correct. So the function is robust.

Therefore, the best approach is to use the built-in sum() function. I'll write that as the solution.
