  **Model Output:**
  Here's a simple Python function to return the sum of a list:
  
  ```python
  def sum_list(numbers):
      return sum(numbers)
  ```
  
  **Usage example:**
  ```python
  print(sum_list([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 10
  print(sum_list([]))           # Output: 0 (handles empty lists automatically)
  ```
  
  This implementation:
  - Uses Python's built-in `sum()` function for efficiency
  - Automatically handles empty lists by returning 0
  - Is concise and readable
  - Works for both integers and floating-point numbers
  
  Would you like me to implement this in a different programming language or add 
  any additional features like error handling?
