  **Model Output:**
  Here's a simple Python function that returns the sum of a list:
  
  ```python
  def sum_list(numbers):
      return sum(numbers)
  ```
  
  This implementation:
  - Handles empty lists by returning 0 (since `sum([])` evaluates to 0)
  - Works with both integers and floating-point numbers
  - Has O(n) time complexity for the summation operation
  
  Would you like me to implement this in a different programming language or add 
  any specific functionality (like handling non-numeric elements)?
