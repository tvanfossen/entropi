  **Model Output:**
  Here's a simple Python function that returns the sum of a list:
  
  ```python
  def sum_list(numbers):
      return sum(numbers)
  ```
  
  This function:
  1. Takes a list of numbers as input
  2. Uses Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total
  3. Returns the result
  
  The function handles empty lists automatically by returning 0, which is the 
  correct mathematical sum of an empty set.
