  **Model Output:**
  Here's a Python function that returns the sum of a list:
  
  ```python
  def sum_list(numbers):
      return sum(numbers)
  ```
  
  This implementation:
  - Takes a list of numbers as input
  - Uses Python's built-in `sum()` function for efficiency
  - Handles empty lists by returning 0 (since sum of empty iterable is 0)
  - Works with both integers and floating-point numbers
  
  Would you like me to implement this manually without using the built-in `sum()` 
  function instead?
