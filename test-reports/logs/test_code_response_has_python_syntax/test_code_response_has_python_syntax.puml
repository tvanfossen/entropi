  **Model Output:**
  I'll write a Python function to calculate the sum of a list. Here's my 
  implementation:
  
  ```python
  def sum_list(numbers):
      """
      Returns the sum of all elements in the input list.
      
      Args:
          numbers (list): A list of numerical values
          
      Returns:
          int/float: The sum of all elements in the list
      """
      return sum(numbers)
  ```
  
  This function:
  1. Takes a list of numbers as input
  2. Uses Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total
  3. Returns the result
  
  The implementation handles empty lists by returning 0 (since sum of an empty 
  list is 0 by default). Would you like me to implement this without using the 
  built-in sum function instead?
