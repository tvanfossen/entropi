/**
 * @file conversation_state.h
 * @brief gh#144: one caller's conversation, as a value.
 *
 * @par Provenance
 * Adapted from `src/facade/conversation_state.h` (v2.0.1), which was written
 * for a facade-owned conversation, included by nothing, and never reached
 * production. Its four operations mapped one-to-one onto the engine's
 * `conversation_` clusters, so the shape was right and the owner was wrong.
 * The old file is deleted rather than left as a dead duplicate.
 *
 * `append_user` / `append_result` are deliberately NOT carried over: their
 * return-a-copy contract does not match `run_drain_loop`, which appends in
 * place. Keeping them would have invited a second, subtly different append
 * path beside the real one.
 *
 * @version 2.12.0
